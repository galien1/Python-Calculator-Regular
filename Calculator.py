number1 = 3
number2 = 3

#You can switch the plus to a minus below:
#             |
#             V
print(number1 * number2)
# total = number1 * number2
# print total
# line 9 will produce an error because you had not closed total inside parenthesis 
# you may use total as third variable but it is better to print it directly just as i changed
